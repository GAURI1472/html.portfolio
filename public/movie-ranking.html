<h1>The best movies according to Gauri</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>3 idiots</h3>
 <p>This is my favourite. It tells us that if we love what we do than nothing seems impossible or difficult.</p>
 <h3>Om shanti Om</h3>
 <p>The perfect tragic romance kind of movie. It builds audience interest by incoporating the theory of reincarnation.</p>
 <h3>Bulbul</h3>
 <p>The story that shows the struggles of women in the old indian patriachal society. How they were treated as lust objects and were not respected. The female character of this movie is the most powerful one who shows how every women has Maa Kaali in her.</p>
